		<h2>Web Development Certificate<br /> 
		(Completed December 2017)</h2>
		<h3>Creating Functional Websites</h3>
		<p>Design and build your own professional and attractive web pages. Learn the basics of the “language of the Internet” through hands-on coding with HTML and CSS.  Discover how to construct your own web pages by using the concepts involved with CSS and HTML5, including such fundamentals as lists, menus, hyperlinks, images, forms, tables, frames and other customizable parts. Explore the creation and production processes involved in website development by examining web interface technologies and their applications. The final project for this class can serve as a portfolio piece to showcase your capabilities to prospective employers.</p>


		<h3>Web Programming with JavaScript</h3>
		<p>Once you have an understanding of how to build static web pages, learning JavaScript is the next step in creating dynamic interactions with your web pages. JavaScript is built directly into web browsers, so learning it requires no extra software tools. Learn the power of JavaScript and discover how to create highly functional, interactive pages that can respond to the web browser and user input. Although a programming background is helpful, it's not a requirement for learning the powerful features of JavaScript. While this is not specifically a programming course, students will learn a great deal about programming while learning JavaScript.</p>


		<h3>Server-Side Scripting with PHP</h3>
		<p>Transform basic websites into interactive experiences using PHP, the most commonly used server-side scripting language.  Server-side scripting languages allow you to create dynamic interactions that are driven by programming logic, data from databases and server files, or content based on user input. Explore dynamic graphics using PHP, as well as the world of syndication and web services.  You’ll also learn how to create secure applications that can handle unexpected user entries.</p>


		<h3>Database Design-Development and Management</h3>
		<p>Gain a hands-on introduction to the basics of modern database terminology, architecture, design and creation, as well as how to access stored data. Acquire the skills to describe the functions of a database management system and its internal components, and construct logical data models for the implementation of a specific database requirement. Students will also learn how to code simple SQL statements to create, retrieve, update and delete data values stored in a relational database.</p>



		<h3>Creating Web Applications with AJAX</h3>
		<p>AJAX has been described as “the special sauce” that makes web magic happen. In reality, it’s a combination of technologies working together to create highly interactive web content. AJAX combines HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and server side scripting to allow fully dynamic page content without the need to reload pages in the browser, including database-driven content. Learning AJAX combines the skills learned in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Database Development and PHP into a complete package, allowing you to build any type of website or web application you need.</p>
